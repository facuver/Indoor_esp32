# Indoor_esp32

This is a Indoor controller based on an esp32, 2 relay arduino board, dht11, capacitive humiudity sensor, and arduino mini pump.

The code is writen in micropython, to use it you have to flash a esp32 board with micropython, and upload all the files in src folder.


the periferics pins can be changed in /src/lib/periferics for custom boards

the frontend is made with svelte and still have to imporovit a lot but it works
